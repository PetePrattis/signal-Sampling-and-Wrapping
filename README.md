# A Matlab Program / Project

**This is a Matlab project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the fourth semester class Principles and Applications of Signals and Systems 
and is one of the final projects for the class_


> #### Description of project
>
>>From a continuous time signal get minimum required sampling frequency to allow the reconstruction of the signal and application of the reconstruction formula of the sampling theorem.


> #### Conclusions of project
>
> * Observing the last graph, we conclude that the signal y2 because it has the highest frequency (f = 1020Hz) of the 4 signals, has the shortest wavelength, while the y3 because it has the least frequency (f = 100Hz) has the longest wavelength . We also realize that the signal y2 is closer to the original signal y = x (t), which means that we have less information loss, whereas at the signal y3 due to the low sampling frequency the signal is significantly different from the original. Therefore, the signal y1 satisfying the sampling theorem is assumed to have little signal loss and holds most of the original signal information faithful.
